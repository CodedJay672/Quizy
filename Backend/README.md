# Quizy Backend Development Design

## Description

Quizy is a web based quizzing platform where users can take and create quizzes across a variety of fields useres also have the ability to create a quizzes which can have any number of multiple choice questions

## Technologies

### Django rest

The Backend uses the python Django rest framework to send JSon formated replies to the front end of the app. It uses various inbuilt serializer classes to parse the incoming data when using PUT, PATCH and UPDATE methods.

### Postgres

The for storing user data we are using Postgres database which is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). The languages ability to use object relational properties has helped us in the project by helping to abstracting the creation of tables that mirror our models and querying the table.

## Testing

The co-creator and enginering leader of django Jacob Kaplan-Moss has said

> Code without tests is broken as designed.

we agree with this statement and understand the need for testing to enusre that codebreaking changes are not added to the main branch of the codebase and to enusre the there is a common understanding on the desired outcome of diffrent views, models, and serilizers we have a set of test for the differnt apps that we will continue to expand
